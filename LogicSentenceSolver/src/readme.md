The LogicPuzzle project this readme is describing is submitted onto the my GitHub repository.
Within the src folder in the LogicSentenceSolver project, there should be two items:
LogicPuzzle.java (the source file) and readme.md (this readme).
These were made as per the specifications in the assignment.

The assignment, although vague in the general description, solidified with the
teacher's explanations into a project that makes the code snippet posted on the assignment page
(copy-and-pasted into the main method) run and output expected results. This included using
several classes to emulate logic gates and propositional constants, as well as creating code to
check if a sentence is legal, create a truth table, evaluate logical sentences, and pinpoint
specific substrings in a logical sentence. This project meets all of those specifications and
slightly more in some aspects. 

At the current stage of development, no errors are immediately present. Further testing may be
required, but as of now nothing needs to be fixed. The code makes the snippet posted in the 
assignment run perfectly. It does this by placing the code snippet in the main method in a
"master" class - this class contains many more classes and methods that do all the actions
required in the specifications. Some major challenges in creating this code included
understanding exactly what the specifications were in order to satisfy them properly, and
creating the findMatch algorithm to do what it's intended to do (described in the javadoc).

Nobody other than the owner of this project had helped on it. Java documentation online was
briefly used to confirm the proper usage of hash maps and subclass constructors.
