Using a template given by a website, this project aims to create an applet that
displays a crudely drawn picture of a cow using only the most basic draw and fill functions
available in the libraries. I also implemented a pseudorandom function to make the spots 
on the cow more convincing, and I made custom drawing methods to make sure the cow's
"body parts" don't overlap.
