The Flag project this readme is describing is submitted onto the my GitHub repository.
Within the src folder in the Scalable Flag project, there should be three items:
Flag.java (the source file), flagProject.jar (the executable), and readme.md (this readme).
These were made as per the specifications in the assignment.

The flag project was very interesting because it taught me many new concepts about Java,
particularly those used to create graphical elements and respond to mouse movements.
My flag is created entirely using graphics (no imported pictures of any kind), and
as far as I can tell every seems to scale (as much as it can be on the lattice).
The flag seems mostly to scale, but when it is very small the stars start acting out and
don't create their shapes correctly anymore - this is probably an unavoidable consequence
of being bound to the lattice.

The flag is resizable (by dragging near the lower-right corner), and it is
also draggable (by clicking anywhere in the flag except the corner). I spent some time
creating the resize function by using the projection of the mouse path onto the flag diagonal.
This involved using the cosine formula for vectors, which complicated the process - however,
eventually I got it to work and the flag resizes depending on which direction you
move your mouse in. This makes the dragging function look a lot nicer.

I haven't implemented resizing on all 4 corners of the flag, so that's one thing my flag can't do.
Also, my dragging function still isn't perfect - the mouse goes way offsync from the corner.
Other than those problems, I don't think my flag has any issues anymore. 
However, the assignment only asked for an applet that drew a to-scale flag that resizes by
any method, so in that respect I definitely fulfilled the assignment specifications.
